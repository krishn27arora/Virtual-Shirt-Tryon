# Virtual-shirt-tryon

This project utilizes computer vision to create a virtual shirt try-on experience. By detecting human body poses, we overlay a shirt on the person based on specific points. This tool provides an innovative way to visualize how different shirts fit, enhancing online shopping and virtual fitting room experiences.

Features : 

Pose Detection: Accurately detects human body poses using advanced computer vision techniques.
Shirt Overlay: Dynamically overlays a shirt on the detected pose points.
Interactive Experience: Allows users to see how different shirts look on them in real-time.
